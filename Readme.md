## Deep Neural Network to classify between cat and non cat Images

Developed a deep neural network with four hidden layers to classify cat and non cat images with 80% accuracy. RELU was used as an activation function for the hidden layers and Sigmoid function has been used as an activation layer for the output layer

No of Epochs: 2400

## Result Analysis:

A few types of images the model tends to do poorly on include the following,

* Cat body in an unusual position
* Cat appears against a background of a similar color
* Unusual cat color and species
* Camera Angle
* Brightness of the picture
* Scale variation (cat is very large or small in image)
